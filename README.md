### All about the program

This program is a cli dev tool program. It allows you to create the projects of your favorite language easily.

### Usage

# Windows

```bash
C:\Users\foo\Desktop> ./project_generator.exe
Welcome to the Project Generator!
 1. Rust
 2. Exit
>
```

Here, you specify the language you want to create a project, here a Rust example.

```console
Welcome to the Project Generator!
 1. Rust
 2. Exit
> 1
```

And it creates your Rust project.

### Disclaimer

For now, the program is only available on Windows, I'm working on a Linux version for soon.
